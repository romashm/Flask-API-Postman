# Flask-API-Postman
This project is need to decrease turnover of papers and unnecessary excel files in the company. I helped company create a cutter which can get rid of extra &amp; same data. 

<h2>Installation & application 🚀 </h2>
<p>Firstly, you should add some packages <code> pip install flask, json, pandas & api</code>. I was given entry json package unsorted with user information. I decided to create a function process_json( ), which had a home adress. Next action, you can abserve it on line <b>16-25</b> I read entry json. Therefore, unpackaged json I decided to sort with complaint information & return result inside excel <b>( library pandas )</b>. </p>
